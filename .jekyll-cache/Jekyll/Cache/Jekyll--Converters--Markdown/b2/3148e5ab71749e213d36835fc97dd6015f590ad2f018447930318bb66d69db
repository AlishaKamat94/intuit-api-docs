I"Ñ<h2 id="authentication">Authentication</h2>

<p>To make API calls, you‚Äôll need:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A QuickBooks company</li>
  <li>An Intuit application</li>
  <li>An OAuth 2.0 access token</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="1-quickbooks-company">1. QuickBooks company</h3>

<p>Depending on your use case (will you be making Payroll API calls?), you‚Äôll need a QuickBooks company setup appropriately (with Payroll).  Partners should reach out to their Intuit point-of-contact to get a company set up.</p>

<h3 id="2-an-intuit-application">2. An Intuit application</h3>

<p>You can create an Intuit application at developer.intuit.com.  Partners should work with their Intuit point-of-contact to make sure the application is correctly onboarded to the new Intuit Ecosystem API.</p>

<h3 id="3-oauth-20-access-token">3. OAuth 2.0 Access Token</h3>

<p>Intuit uses the standard OAuth 2.0 protocol.  For details on OAuth 2.0 at Intuit, refer to <a href="https://developer.intuit.com/app/developer/qbo/docs/develop/authentication-and-authorization/oauth-2.0">this document</a>.  The <a href="https://developer.intuit.com/app/developer/qbo/docs/develop/authentication-and-authorization/oauth-2.0-playground">OAuth 2.0 playground</a> may also be helpful to learn about the OAuth flow.</p>

<h4 id="scopes">Scopes</h4>

<p>In the new Intuit Ecosystem API, there are new additional scopes, beyond the previous high-level ‚Äúaccounting‚Äù and ‚Äúpayment‚Äù scopes.  For a list of scopes in the new Intuit Ecosystem API, <a href="Scopes">check here</a>.  You‚Äôll need to find the scopes relevant for your use case, and make sure to request them when generating the OAuth 2.0 Access Token.</p>
