<p>Intuitâ€™s Ecosystem API is a new offering for developers wanting to integrate with the Intuit business ecosystem. This API is a GraphQL API that addresses many of the challenges of the previous versions, has a simpler schema and is more secure. Our guiding principles have been to make this a platform that delivers business domain use-case based functionality with granular access control and a simplified schema to enable deep integrations with Intuit products.</p>
